It's a quick and dirty integrtion for the BESEN BS20 wall EV charger.
If you have any suggestions (for example unmapped vaules, or others) please
feel free to post an [issue](https://github.com/sustainabledeveloper/bs20/issues).

Installation is easiest via the [Home Assistant Community Store
(HACS)](https://hacs.xyz/), which is the best place to get third-party
integrations for Home Assistant. Once you have HACS set up, simply click the button below (requires My Homeassistant configured) or
follow the [instructions for adding a custom
repository](https://hacs.xyz/docs/faq/custom_repositories) and then
the integration will be available to install like any other.

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=sustainabledeveloper&repository=bs20&category=integration)
